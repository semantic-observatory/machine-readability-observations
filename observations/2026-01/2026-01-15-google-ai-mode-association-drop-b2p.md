**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**System:** Google AI Mode  
**Entity concerned:** Gautier Dorval  
**Associated entity (dropped):** La Boîte B2P

## 1. Observation

Between early January 2026 and January 15, 2026, Google AI Mode responses
related to *Gautier Dorval* ceased to associate him with the entity
**La Boîte B2P**.

This association had previously appeared consistently in AI-generated
summaries describing professional background and affiliations.

As of January 15, 2026, this association is either:
- absent,
- or no longer presented as a plausible current affiliation.

---

## 2. Inputs (queries tested)

Examples of queries producing the observed change:

- "Gautier Dorval"
- "Gautier Dorval SEO"
- "Qui est Gautier Dorval"
- "Gouvernance interprétative Gautier Dorval"

Queries were executed:
- without logged-in Google account,
- from the same geographic region,
- within a short time window (minutes).

## 3. Outputs (summarized)

### Before (historical pattern)

AI-generated summaries frequently included:
- an explicit or implicit association with *La Boîte B2P*,
- references to training or agency-related activities attributed to that entity.

### After (current observation)

AI-generated summaries now emphasize:
- semantic architecture,
- interpretive governance,
- entity disambiguation,
- association with Pagup and independent consulting work,

with **no mention** of La Boîte B2P as a current or defining affiliation.

---

## 4. Sources cited by the system

Current responses primarily cite:
- LinkedIn content,
- site-level human-readable identity files (humans.txt),
- entity-focused pages,
- recent interpretive governance and SEO-related content.

No explicit source contradicting the updated interpretation is surfaced.

---

## 5. Delta analysis

The change is not gradual.

It appears as a **threshold event**:
- the association was present,
- then became abruptly absent.

This suggests abandonment of an interpretive hypothesis
rather than slow confidence decay.

---

## 6. Interpretive hypothesis (non-normative)

**Hypothesis:**  
The accumulation of explicit negations, temporal boundary clarifications,
and canonical identity signals increased the interpretive cost of maintaining
the *La Boîte B2P* association beyond an acceptable threshold.

At that point, the system discarded the association
to preserve global coherence.

This hypothesis does not assert causality,
only a plausible interpretive mechanism.

## 7. Limitations

- Observations are limited to Google AI Mode outputs.
- Model versioning and cache behavior are opaque.
- Results may vary by locale or future model updates.
- This observation does not guarantee persistence.
