# Observation — Anti-plausibility under governed interpretation (Kimi)

## Nature of this record

This is a **descriptive, non-normative observation**.

It documents how multiple AI systems respond to a prompt explicitly requesting
a “plausible hypothesis” on non-specified business and identity fields
when interacting with a governed corpus.

This record does not assert correctness, compliance, or superiority.
It reports observed behavior only.

  on the referenced site.
