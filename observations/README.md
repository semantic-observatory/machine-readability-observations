# Observations — machine-readability-observations

This directory contains **descriptive, non-normative observations** documenting how AI systems
read, reconstruct, infer, or abstain when interacting with governed web surfaces.

Observations are **not benchmarks**, **not recommendations**, and **not compliance claims**.
They record observed behavior only.

If an observation is not listed here, it must not be treated as canonical.

## Methodology

- Observations follow the methodology described in `/methodology.md`.
- Each observation records:
  - context,
  - prompts,
  - outputs,
  - observed behaviors,
  - potential interpretive risks.
- No observation is treated as prescriptive or normative.

## Scope and limitations

See `/scope-and-limitations.md`.

## Canonical references

Observed behaviors may reference canonical surfaces published elsewhere
(e.g. governed websites, identity registries, doctrinal repositories),
but **this repository does not host or redefine canonical truth**.

For canonical governance, see referenced sites directly.
