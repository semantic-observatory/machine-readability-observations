# Observations

This directory contains time-bound, context-specific observations.

Rules:
- No claims, only observations and falsifiable hypotheses.
- No generalization beyond the documented context.
- No inference of intent, ranking mechanisms, or internal system design.

Each observation stands on its own and may be contradicted by future evidence.
