# Cross-model convergence

Date: 2025-12

---

## Observation context

This observation compares how different AI models
describe the same publicly documented entity or structure.

---

## Points of convergence

Across models:

- Core roles and domains were similarly identified.
- Major semantic boundaries were respected.
- Extreme claims or unsupported assertions were rare.

---

## Points of divergence

Differences were observed in:

- level of detail,
- narrative tone,
- emphasis on technical vs strategic aspects.

These differences did not fundamentally alter entity interpretation.

---

## Interpretation

Convergence across models suggests that
clear, bounded public documentation
reduces interpretive variance.

This does not eliminate divergence,
but appears to narrow its range.
