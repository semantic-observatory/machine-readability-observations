# Semantic boundaries and negative definitions

Date: 2025-12

---

## Observation context

This observation focuses on the presence of explicit negative definitions
(i.e. statements describing what an entity is not or does not provide)
within public web content.

---

## Observed behavior

When negative definitions were present:

- AI systems were less likely to infer unavailable services.
- Assumptions based on industry stereotypes were reduced.
- Summaries showed tighter semantic scope.

---

## Comparative note

In contexts without explicit negative boundaries:

- AI systems occasionally extrapolated plausible but incorrect services.
- Geographic or operational scope was sometimes broadened implicitly.

---

## Interpretation

Negative definitions appear to function as semantic constraints,
reducing the model’s tendency to fill gaps with probabilistic assumptions.

This effect is interpretive, not deterministic.
