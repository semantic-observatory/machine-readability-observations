# Boundary files are consulted before explanatory content

**Date:** December 2025  
**Context:** Public websites exposing machine-readable governance, boundary, and explanatory files  
**Models / systems involved:** Multiple AI systems (exact identification not asserted)

## Setup
Public websites exposed a structured set of machine-readable files,
including governance, boundary, exclusion, and explanatory documents.
No access restrictions or authentication mechanisms were involved.

## Observation
Access patterns show repeated retrieval of files defining limits, exclusions,
responsibility boundaries, and non-goals before files primarily intended to explain concepts or functionality.

This pattern was observed within days of publication.

## Hypothesis
AI systems may prioritize boundary definition to reduce interpretative risk
before attempting semantic expansion or summarization.

## Counter-hypotheses
- Automated security or monitoring tools triggered the access pattern.
- Crawling heuristics unrelated to semantic interpretation.
- Coincidental ordering without semantic intent.

## What would falsify this observation
- Repeated observation of explanatory content being accessed first
  across multiple independent setups.
- Evidence that access order is purely alphabetical or infrastructural.

## Notes
This observation does not assert causality, optimization impact,
or long-term behavioral stability.
